# DuckHunterRemake

## Description
Duration: 1 week sprint

We are recreating a childhood favorite game: Duck Hunter. The most basic concept is to 'shoot' the birds as they fly up. Traditionally this was a video game where you would have a toy gun to shoot them, but in our version you'll use the mouse. The object is to get all the birds before they fly away.
