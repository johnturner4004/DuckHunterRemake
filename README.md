# DuckHunterRemake

## Description
Duration: 1 week sprint

We are recreating a childhood favorite game: Duck Hunt. The most basic concept is to 'shoot' the birds as they fly up. Traditionally this was a video game where you would have a toy gun to shoot them, but in our version you'll use the mouse. The object is to get all the birds before they fly away.

## Installation

1. Fork or clone the repository and open in your favorite code editor; we used VS Code
1. Open a terminal window (making sure you're in the DuckHunterRemake file) and run npm install
